summary: "Because the phrase “questions of law” in the Immigration and Nationality Act’s Limited Review Provision, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), includes the application of a legal standard to undisputed or established facts, the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that it had no jurisdiction to consider petitioners’ “factual” due diligence claims for equitable tolling purposes."
