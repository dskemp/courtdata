summary: "The Fourth Circuit’s “special circumstances” exception to the Prison Litigation Reform Act’s exhaustion requirement is inconsistent with the Act’s unambiguous mandate that an inmate exhaust all administrative remedies before filing suit, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); but respondent’s contention that his prison’s grievance process was not in fact available to him warrants further consideration below."
