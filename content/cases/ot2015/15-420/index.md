summary: "Because respondent’s tribal-court convictions were valid when entered, using those convictions as predicate offenses in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 117(a)—which makes it a federal crime for a person with two prior convictions for domestic violence to commit “domestic assault within . . . Indian country”—does not violate the Constitution."
