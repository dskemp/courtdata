summary: "Under this Court’s “rule of contemporary assessment of counsel’s conduct,” Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 372, Kulbicki’s counsel’s failure to unearth a 1991 report on a then-uncontroversial mode of ballistics analysis, identify its methodological flaw, and use that flaw against the State’s expert witness did not constitute deficient performance."
