summary: "A Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act provision that authorizes a civil cause of action for “[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation” of specified RICO substantive provisions, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, irrespective of any extraterritoriality of RICO’s substantive provisions; and thus a private RICO plaintiff must allege and prove a domestic injury."
