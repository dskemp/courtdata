summary: "The due process rights of death-row inmate Williams were violated when Pennsylvania Supreme Court Chief Justice Castille, formerly the district attorney who approved the request to seek the death penalty against Williams, denied Williams’s recusal motion and participated in the decision to vacate a postconviction court’s order granting Williams relief; an unconstitutional failure to recuse constitutes structural error that is “not amenable” to harmless-error review, regardless of whether the judge’s vote was dispositive."
