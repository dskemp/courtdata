summary: "The Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of 16 U.S.C. § 3103(c), which addresses the scope of the National Park Service’s authority over “non-public” lands that fall within the boundaries of Alaska’s federally preserved “conservation system units,” is inconsistent with both the text and the context of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act."
