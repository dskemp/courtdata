summary: "Because 38 U.S.C. § 8127(d)’s contracting procedures are mandatory and apply to all of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ contracting determinations, the Department’s decision to procure technology services through the Federal Supply Schedule rather than employ the “Rule of Two,” which generally restricts contracting competition to veteran-owned small businesses, was unlawful."
