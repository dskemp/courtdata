summary: "Respondent’s federal suit against petitioner, the Austrian state-owned railway, which arose from traumatic injuries she suffered while attempting to board a train in Austria, was not “based upon” the U.S. sale of a Eurail pass for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), the “commercial activity” exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and is therefore barred by sovereign immunity."
