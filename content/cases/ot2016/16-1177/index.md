summary: "In this federal habeas case, the Fourth Circuit erred in concluding that the Virginia trial court’s ruling—that the Commonwealth’s geriatric release program provides a meaningful opportunity for juvenile nonhomicide offenders to receive conditional release—was objectively unreasonable in light of Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010)."
