summary: "Because subrogation and reimbursement prescriptions in federal employees’ health insurance contracts that the Office of Personnel Management negotiates with private carriers plainly “relate to . . . payments with respect to benefits” under 5 U.S.C. § 8902(m)(1)—the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959’s express preemption provision—they override state laws barring subrogation and reimbursement; the regime Congress enacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause."
