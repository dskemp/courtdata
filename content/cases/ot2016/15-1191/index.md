summary: "The gender-based differential in the law governing acquisition of U.S. citizenship by a child born abroad, when only one parent is a U.S. citizen—a shorter duration-of-residency requirement for unwed U.S.-citizen mothers than for unwed U.S.-citizen fathers—is incompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the laws”; it falls to Congress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages any person on the basis of gender; in the interim, the current requirement for unwed U.S.-citizen fathers should apply, prospectively, to children born to unwed U.S.-citizen mothers."
