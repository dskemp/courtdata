summary: "The District Court employed an incorrect legal standard in concluding that race was not the predominant factor in the Virginia Legislature’s design for 11 of the 12 state legislative districts challenged in this case, but the court did not err in concluding that the lines for the remaining district were constitutional because the legislature’s use of race, though predominant, was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest."
