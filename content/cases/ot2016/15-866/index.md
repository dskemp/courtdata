summary: "The test for determining whether a feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection—whether the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article, and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression, if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated—is satisfied in this case."
