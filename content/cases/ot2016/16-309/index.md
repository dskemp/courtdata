summary: "To secure a conviction for unlawfully procuring citizenship in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1425(a), the Government must establish that the defendant’s illegal act played a role in acquiring citizenship, and where that alleged illegality is a false statement to government officials, the jury must decide whether the statement so altered the process as to have influenced the award of citizenship; here, the District Court erred in instructing the jury that Maslenjak’s false statements need not have influenced the naturalization decision."
