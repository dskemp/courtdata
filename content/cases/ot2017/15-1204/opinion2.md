Justice Thomas concurred in part and concurred in the judgment reversing the lower court and remanding the case. In his view, joined by Justice Gorsuch, no court has jurisdiction over this case because ยง 1252(b)(9) prohibits courts from reviewing removal claims, except in a petition for review from a final removal order. However, if the Court did have jurisdiction, he would agree with the majority on the merits.
