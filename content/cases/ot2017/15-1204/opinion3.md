In dissent, Justice Breyer argued that the Court’s reading of the statute as forbidding bail for the non-citizen asylum seekers in this case would likely render the statute unconstitutional. Justice Breyer would follow the Court’ “longstanding practice” of construing statutes so as to avoid the conclusion or “gave doubts” that it is unconstitutional and thus would interpret it as requiring bail hearings, presumptively after six months of confinement.
