Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court, as to all but Part II. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy joined in full. Justices Thomas and Gorsuch joined as to all but Part II. Justice Sotomayor joined only as to Part III-C.

The plurality (Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy) first considered two potential obstacles to the exercise of jurisdiction, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(b)(9) and 1226(e), finding that neither deprived the Court of jurisdiction. The majority (Alito, Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, and Gorsuch) then concluded that, subject only to express exceptions, §§ 1225(b) and 1226(c) authorize detention until the end of the applicable proceedings. Finally, the majority (Alito, Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, Gorsuch, and Sotomayor) concluded that §1226(a) does not support requiring the Government to provide procedural protections beyond an initial bond hearing, such as periodic bond hearings.
