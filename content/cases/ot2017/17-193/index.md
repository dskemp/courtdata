summary: "The Eleventh Circuit erred in granting habeas relief where the state court’s determination—that respondent was competent to be executed because he recognized that he would be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed—was not an unreasonable application of this Court’s case law nor an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before it."
