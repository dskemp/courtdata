summary: "Because Hill’s intellectual disability claim must be evaluated based solely on holdings of this Court that were clearly established at the time the state-court decisions were rendered, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit’s reliance on Moore v. Texas, 581 U.S. ___—which was handed down much later—was plainly improper."
