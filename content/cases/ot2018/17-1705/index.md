summary: "The extent to which a 2006 FCC Order interpreting the term “unsolicited advertisement” binds lower courts may depend on the resolution of two preliminary questions that the Fourth Circuit should address in the first instance: (1) whether the Order is the equivalent of a legislative rule, which has the force and effect of law, or an interpretative rule, which does not; and (2) whether petitioners had a “prior” and “adequate” opportunity to seek judicial review of the Order."
