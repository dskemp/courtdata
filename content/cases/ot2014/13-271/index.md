ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 305, but leaves retail prices to state regulation, does not pre-empt respondents’ state-law antitrust claims against interstate gas pipelines for engaging in behavior that not only resulted in higher retail costs for respondents but also affected federally regulated wholesale prices."
