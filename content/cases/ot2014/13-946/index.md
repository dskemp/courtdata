summary: "The Ninth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief based on its own precedent, where this Court’s case law had not ‘clearly establish[ed]’ that a defendant adequately apprised of the possibility of conviction on an aiding-and-abetting theory can nevertheless be deprived of adequate notice by a prosecutorial decision to focus on another theory at trial, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1)."
