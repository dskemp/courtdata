summary: "Where CSX challenged Alabama’s sales and use taxes as discriminatory under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, the Eleventh Circuit properly concluded that CSX’s transportation industry competitors—motor carriers and water carriers—are an appropriate comparison class for CSX’s claim, but that court erred in refusing to consider whether Alabama could justify its decision to exempt motor carriers from its sales and use taxes through its decision to subject motor carriers to a fuel-excise tax."
