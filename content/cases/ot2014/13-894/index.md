summary: "Respondent’s communication to a reporter about canceled air marshal missions is not excluded from federal whistleblower protection as a disclosure “specifically prohibited by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 2302(b)(8)(A), because the Transportation Security Administration regulation prohibiting his disclosure does not qualify as “law,” and because the law authorizing the regulation, 49 U.S.C. § 114(r)(1), does not specifically prohibit his disclosure."
