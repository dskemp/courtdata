The dissent criticized the majority’s reasoning, claiming that the petitioners’ constitutional claims are dissimilar to those Congress intended to channel through the Board. The dissent argued that the Board lacks authority to adjudicate facial constitutional challenges and that they are “wholly collateral” to the types of claims the Board is authorized to hear. As such, Congress could not have intended to channel claims into an administrative tribunal that is powerless to decide them.
