The majority first considered the appropriate standard for determining whether a statutory scheme of administrative and judicial review provides the exclusive means of review for constitutional claims. It reasoned that the “heightened showing” standard recognized in _Webster v. Doe_, 486 U.S. 592 (1988), and advocated by the petitioners in this case does not apply where Congress simply “channels” judicial review of a constitutional claim to a particular court, as in this case. Because the _Webster_ “heightened showing” standard does not apply, the majority concluded the appropriate inquiry was whether it is “fairly discernable” from the CSRA that Congress intended covered employees appealing covered agency actions to proceed exclusively through the statutory review scheme.

Having established the appropriate standard, the majority then examined the text, structure, and purpose of CSRA. The majority found nothing in CSRA’s text to suggest that its exclusive review scheme does not apply simply because a covered employee challenges a covered action on the ground that the authorizing statute is unconstitutional. Additionally, the purpose of CSRA -- to establish an “integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review” for aggrieved federal employees -- supports the majority’s construction of the statute.
