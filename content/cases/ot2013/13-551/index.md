summary: "Because the Fifth Circuit failed to adhere to the fundamental principle that, at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the non-moving party, the decision below is vacated and remanded so that the Fifth Circuit can determine whether, when the evidence offered by the petitioner—who was shot by the respondent, a police officer—is properly credited and factual inferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, the police officer’s actions violated clearly established law."
