summary: "For purposes of “aiding and abetting” liability under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which prohibits “us[ing] or carr[ying] a firearm “during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,” the government must show that the defendant actively participated in the underlying drug trafficking or violent crime with advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crime’s commission. The Court vacated the decision below and remanded the case because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the defendant must have “advance knowledge” – that is, knowledge sufficiently in advance to have some “realistic opportunity to quit the crime” – that the gun would be used or carried."
