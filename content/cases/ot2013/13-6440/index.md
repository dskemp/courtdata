summary: "The failure of the lawyer for a defendant in a capital murder trial to seek additional funds to hire, as a replacement for an expert whom he knew to be inadequate, an expert to rebut the core of the prosecution""s case was unreasonable, and therefore constitutionally deficient, when that failure was based not on any strategic decision, but rather on a mistaken belief that available funding was capped at $1,000. The Court therefore summarily vacated the judgment below and remanded the case for reconsideration of whether the attorney""s deficient performance was prejudicial."
